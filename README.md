# The-Aetherius-Engine
Quantum-Probabilistic Neuromorphic Simulator

Version: v3.2.1 Language: Python 3.10+

🌌 Overview
The Aetherius Engine is a sophisticated simulation framework designed to model high-dimensional topological networks within a simulated Hilbert space. Unlike traditional deterministic state machines, the Aetherius Kernel utilizes a stochastic approach to model information propagation, where nodes exist in a state of quantum superposition until interaction forces a wavefunction collapse.

This project serves as a visualizer for complex system entropy, measuring the coherence of entangled qubit signals against a backdrop of increasing thermal noise and potential singularity events.

🚀 Key Features
Asynchronous Event Loop: Powered by a custom asyncio kernel for non-blocking signal propagation and physics calculations.

Hilbert Space Topology: Simulates nodes with complex amplitude and phase vectors, visualized through dynamic color-shifting and "ghosting" effects during high-energy states.

Singularity Generator: A dynamic mechanic where critical entropy levels trigger the formation of a simulated Event Horizon, resulting in catastrophic topology accretion and subsequent expulsion.

Entropy Injection System: Allows for manual destabilization of the kernel, injecting chaotic thermal noise to test network resilience.

Reactive Cyber-HUD: Real-time telemetry graphing system entropy, coherence percentages, and Born probability densities.

🎮 Controls & Interaction
Left Click + Drag: Manually manipulate node topology and override local physics.

Right Click (Hold): Generate a local Gravity Well to influence node trajectories.

Spacebar: Toggle Instability Mode (Inject System Entropy).

B: Toggle the Singularity Mechanic (Enable/Disable Black Hole generation).

R: Initiate System Restore (Hard Reset of physics and energy states).

🛠️ Architecture
The codebase features a highly modular architecture utilizing Python's advanced metaprogramming capabilities:

Metaclass Component Registry: Automatic registration of neuromorphic components.

Atomic Transactions: Decorator-based state management for thread-safe physics updates.

Type-Strict Definitions: Extensive use of Generic and TypeVar for robust data structure definitions.
